    "Good morning! What can I get started for you today?",
    "Welcome! Are you in the mood for a coffee or perhaps something else?",
    "Hi there! What would you like to order?",
    "Can I start by asking if you prefer hot or iced coffee today?",
    "What kind of coffee are you looking for—espresso, latte, or maybe something different?",
    "To begin, do you have a favorite drink in mind, or would you like to see our menu?",
    "Let’s talk about your coffee choice—do you have any preferences for size or sweetness?",
    "Can I confirm if you'd like to dine in or take your coffee to go?",
    "Could you let us know if you have any specific preferences, like decaf or plant-based milk?"
